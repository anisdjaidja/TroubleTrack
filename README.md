# TroubleTrack üêû API DOCS üìÑ
The TroubleTrack API provides tools, and resources that enable you to report, update and track errors related to frontend development of your projects.
# Getting started

- The API only responds to HTTPS-secured communications. Any requests sent via HTTP return an HTTP 301 redirect to the corresponding HTTPS resources.

- The API returns request responses in JSON format. When an API request returns an error, it is sent in the JSON response as an error key.

- Some TroubleTrack API endpoints requires authentification and Authorised accounts are intenally managed, for full access please ask the maitenance team for a dedicated account.

## Authentication üîê
- The TroubleTrack API uses JWT (Jason web token) for authentication.
You can generate a Token by using the Login endpoit

- For endpoints that require auth, you must include a Token in each request to the API as a Token Bearer (if you are using postman).

- If the provided user credentials are invalid you will receive an HTTP 401 Unauthorized response code.

### Login endpoint ```/api/projects/auth```
Request
``` json
Body:
{
  "email": "anis",
  "password": "123"

## Endpoints ‚ùáÔ∏è

- These endpoints require authentification and can be accessed only by token bearers.
  
- An error HTTP 415 Unsupported media response means that the resquest body is not in json format or doesnt comply with data schema.
  
- An error HTTP 404 Not found response means that the specified route is not valid.

- An error HTTP 401 Unauthorized response means that you are not authorised to make such actions or your token has expired and you need to log in again.
  
- An HTTP 5xx response will almost never occure due to the internal database being auto-reconnected automatically.
  
- This API has a cold start behavior, meaning the very first request will take a brief time to reponde due to a fresh reconnection attempt to the database.
